                <div class="content">
                    <p>Some of the most successful websites on the internet are simple ideas that have been well executed. At the core of these websites is the ability to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data.</p>
<p>In this assignment, you will create your own web application that uses Java EE technologies to implement CRUD functionality.</p>
                </div>
            </div>            <div class="section">
                <input id="sec3" type="checkbox" autocomplete="off" />
                <label for="sec3"><h2>Task</h2></label>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>For this assignment, you will create a simple web application that incorporates the following minimum functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Login</li>
<li>Create a record</li>
<li>View or search for records</li>
<li>Edit a record</li>
<li>Delete a record</li>
<li>Logout</li>
</ul>
<p>The records can be anything you wish. You will need to decide for yourself what purpose your website will serve:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might consider building an application to help a loved family member (<em>e.g.</em>, a Wedding Invitation Tracker).</li>
<li>You might consider building an application for your work (<em>e.g.</em>, a Safety Incident Register). </li>
<li>You could build an extremely low-fidelity imitation of a popular website (<em>e.g.</em>, create your own Tinder or Reddit). </li>
</ul>
<p>You will not be assessed on the quality of your idea.
The idea does not have to be &lsquo;good&rsquo; so long as you implement it well (<em>i.e.</em>, using patterns and principles covered in this subject).</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must <strong>NOT</strong> create an application that is sexist, pornographic, vulgar, hateful or otherwise inappropriate in a professional setting.</li>
<li>You must <strong>NOT</strong> create an &lsquo;Address Book&rsquo; or &lsquo;To do list&rsquo; application.</li>
</ul>

                <label for="sec4"><h2>Functional Requirements</h2></label>
                <div class="content">
                    <h3>Core Functionality</h3>
<p>Your web application will need to have login functionality as well as the ability to create, read, update and delete (&ldquo;CRUD&rdquo;) records in a simple database schema.</p>
<p>In other words, your web application must have the following core functionality:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in (for the core functionality, you can have built-in user accounts)</li>
<li>Create a record (e.g., <code>INSERT INTO ...</code>) </li>
<li>List records (e.g., <code>SELECT ... WHERE ...</code>)</li>
<li>View a record (e.g., <code>SELECT ... WHERE id = ?</code>)</li>
<li>Update a record (e.g., <code>UPDATE...</code>)</li>
<li>Delete (or hide) a record (e.g., <code>DELETE ...</code> or <code>UPDATE ... SET visible = 'N' WHERE id = ?</code>)</li>
<li>Log out</li>
<li>Your application <strong>must</strong> provide useful error messages if the user enters invalid input</li>
</ol>
<h3>Innovation Functionality</h3>
<p>In addition to the core functionality, 10 marks are devoted to innovative use of Java EE technologies. To get 10 marks, you would be expected to choose to implement three of the following features.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to create new accounts</li>
<li>Upload and viewing of photos or videos</li>
<li>Ability for users to export their data in XML or CSV format</li>
<li>Polished, beautiful user interface</li>
<li>Use of a multiple-step &lsquo;wizard&rsquo;-style user interface (<em>e.g.</em>, a multi-step account creation or a multi-step credit-card data entry)</li>
<li>The ability to log in and create, read, update and delete <strong>more than</strong> one type of record</li>
<li>Responsive functionality using AJAX or Websockets</li>
</ol>
<p>You are not limited to this list: please feel free to negotiate alternative functionality of comparable difficulty with your tutor.</p>
<h3>Functionality Proposals</h3>
<p>You must propose your application to your tutor during the first two weeks of semester.</p>
<p>Your tutor will provide the following template for you to complete:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>(Application Name)</em></strong>: <br/>
My application will help <em>(user)</em> to <em>(need)</em> by keeping track of <em>(record)</em>.<br/>
My application will allow users to login and then create, read, update and delete <em>(records)</em>.<br/>
In addition, my application will <em>(provide innovation functionality)</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider the following three examples of how to use the above template:</p>
<p>1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>UTS Accident Register:</em></strong> <br/>
My application will help <em>UTS staff</em> to <em>improve safety on campus</em> by keeping track of <em>accidents that have occurred</em>. <br/>
My application will allow users to login and then create, read, update and delete <em>accident reports</em>. <br/>
In addition, my application will <em>offer a step-by-step accident report creation wizard (5), allow users to upload photos (2) and have a beautiful user interface (4)</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>My Tinder:</em></strong> <br/>
My application will help <em>single people</em> to <em>find love</em> by keeping track of <em>matches</em>. <br/>
My application will allow users login and then create, read, update and delete <em>profile matches</em>. <br/>
In addition, my application will <em>allow users to create new accounts (1), post messages to each other (6) and have responsive live notifications of matches (7)</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Ben&rsquo;s Cookbook:</em></strong> <br/>
My application will help <em>Ben</em> to <em>cook</em> by keeping track of <em>recipes</em>. <br/>
My application will allow users login and then create, read, update and delete <em>recipes</em>. <br/>
In addition, my application will <em>allow Ben to upload photos (1), have friends comment on recipes (6) and allow export into Excel using CSV (3)</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
