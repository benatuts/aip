                    <p>Attend the first hour of eight (out of ten) scheduled lab sessions and solve a problem posed by your tutor.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 20% of your final grade</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Type:</strong> Group and individual activities</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> This activity assesses objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 from the subject outline.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the semester, there will be ten assessed activities to be completed during the allocated laboratory time.
These activities are designed to help you learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>They will give you an opportunity to recieve feedback on your learning.</li>
<li>They will help you reinforce important concepts.</li>
<li>They will help you put theory into practice.</li>
<li>They will help you understand connections between the subject content and other issues in internet development.</li>
<li>They will help you think more critically about your own work.</li>
<li>They will help you develop confidence in problem solving.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each activity will be different.
There will be a range of activities including individual and group work. 
They may involve making a presentation, writing code, debugging code or other learning activities relevant to the subject.</p>
<p>Shortly after the start of the weekly laboratory session, a problem or question will be posed along with criteria for success.
You will need to work on the problem within the allocated time and formulate a solution or answer.</p>
<p>Upon completion, you will be given an immediate result and feedback (if appropriate) each week.</p>
<p>Each activity is equally weighted and marked out of 2.5.
Your highest eight results will be added, to result in a maximum possible mark of 20 (i.e., 8 * 2.5 = 20).</p>
<p>If you do not attend or if you have not completed the preparation activities prior to class, you will receive a result of zero for that week and your tutor may ask you to leave the room.</p>

                    <p>These activities are designed to encourage collaboration and exploration. You will be encouraged to work with your peers. However, obtaining outside assistance is not permitted.</p>
<p>If you are in doubt, please ask your tutor.
Please refer to the faculty&rsquo;s handbook for more information about Student Misconduct:

<h3>Grading</h3>
<ul>
<li>This assessment counts 20% towards your final grade.</li>
<li>The requirements will be made clear for each weekly activity.</li>
<li>You will be informed within the tutorial if your work is of an unacceptable standard.</li>
<li>You will not have an opportunity to resubmit. However, there are 10 assessed activities so you will still have an opportunity to fail (or not attend) two weeks and still obtain full marks.</li>
