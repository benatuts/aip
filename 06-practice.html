                    <p>The lecture this week was about design, rather than code. 
The tutorial does not have worked-through activities like previous weeks.
Please feel free to use this time to ask your tutor questions, to suggest topics for class discussion and to work on your assignment.</p>

                    <p>Whether or not you have completed Assignment 1, please open your Assignment files and browse through the code.</p>
<p>For each class in your project, decide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which layer does the class belong to?</li>
<li>What would need to be changed if you used a different data store (e.g., you'll use JPA instead of JDBC in Assignment 2)?</li>
<li>What would need to be changed if you created a mobile or console interface?</li>
<li>How could you improve the separation into layers?</li>
</ol>
<p>In the deeper study, a number of design patterns were mentioned.
Do you recognize any of these design patterns in your code?</p>
