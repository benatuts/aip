<p>I've attached two NetBeans projects zipped into a single file. It contains the worked exercises: Week10-server and Week10-client.</p>
<p>To use the project, you should deploy the Week10-server before using the Week10-client. You can run the single-page web app by running the Week10-server project (<code>index.html</code>). You can run the JavaServer Faces client by using the Week10-client (<code>index.xhtml</code>).</p>
<p>I encourage you to attempt the problems yourself before "peeking" at the solutions.</p>
<p>The solutions I've provided are just one of many possible ways to achieve the same effect. If your code is different, but still works, it doesn't necessarily mean that you are "wrong". In fact, your solution may be better than the ones that I have provided. I suggest looking at the differences and understanding why you and I have made different design choices.</p>
